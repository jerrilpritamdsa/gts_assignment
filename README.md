The Python exercise test assesses knowledge of programming in Python language, machine learning algorithms and computer vision.


1. Create a python program that segregates a folder of 100 images into 15 folders depending on the identity of the person. 
Image Folder: Consists of 100 images of 15 different persons
You may follow these instructions:
Identify the files in the folder and extract the name of each file.
Define a list of identities for the people you want to segregate the files for.
Create a dictionary that maps each identity to a folder name.
Iterate through the list of files and for each file, extract the identity of the person from the file name.
Check if the identity exists in the dictionary, and if it does, move the file to the corresponding folder. If the identity does not exist in the dictionary, create a new folder with the name of the identity, and move the file to the newly created folder.
Please refer trainmodel.py and testmodel.py for the code

2. Create a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using an ML algorithm that can recognize handwritten digits. You may use any database of handwritten digits which is available online.
Please refer to hand_writing_recognition.ipynb for the code
